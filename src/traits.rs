//! Traits for describing strong and weak pointers and their use as elements and keys.
//!
//! These traits provide mechanisms for converting between weak and strong pointers
//! ([`WeakElement`](trait.WeakElement.html)) and for dereferencing strong pointers
//! ([`WeakKey`](trait.WeakKey.html)). Implementations of these traits are provided for
//! `std::rc::Weak` and `std::sync::Weak`. If you would like to use your own pointer type
//! as a weak element, you need to implement `WeakElement` for your weak pointer type; to use it
//! as a weak key, implement `WeakKey` as well.

/// Interface for elements that can be stored in weak hash tables.
///
/// This trait applies to the weak version of a reference-counted pointer; it can be used to
/// convert a weak pointer into a strong pointer and back. For example, the impl for
/// `std::rc::Weak<T>` defines the `Strong` associated type as `std::rc::Rc<T>`. Then method
/// `new` can be used to downgrade an `Rc<T>` to a `Weak<T>`, and method `view` can be used to
/// upgrade a `Weak<T>` into an `Rc<T>`, if it's still alive. If we think of the weak pointer as
/// what is stored, then the strong pointer is a temporary view of it.

    /// necessary to get the lifetimes right in cases where the key is not actually store in the
    /// strong pointer.
